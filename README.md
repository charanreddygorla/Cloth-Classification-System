# Cloth-Classification-System

This project implements a machine learning-based solution to classify clothing types either by live camera input or by uploading an image, providing a flexible and interactive user experience.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

Python 3

Machine Learning Libraries:  

      TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning model)
      OpenCV (for camera and image processing)
      NumPy, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for prototyping and testing)

## 📊 Features

Camera-Based Classification:

    Capture real-time images from a connected camera.
    Automatically predict the type of clothing.

Image Upload Classification:

    Upload an image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG) manually.
    Display the image and classify the clothing item.

Pre-trained Model:

    Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for fast and accurate predictions.

User-Friendly Interface:

    Simple workflows in Jupyter Notebooks.
    Clear instructions and output visualization.
